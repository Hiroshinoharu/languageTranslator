## Project: Language Translator App Lingualink in Pyhton

# Overview

# Project Structure:
To ensure code organisation and modularity, the project is divided into five packages, each responsible for a certain functionality.


## Object-Oriented Principles
Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction are examples of OOP principles employed throughout the implementation. 

The classes and objects are intended to reflect real-world entities and encapsulate related functionality, hence encouraging code reuse, maintainability, and scalability.
